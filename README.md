# Image-Compression
Image Compression using SVD

Let a matrix M represent a gray-scale image. Let M â€œ USV J be a SVD of M. As seen in
class, by deleting all singular values but the first k we get a rank-k compression of the image.
In the next programming task you are required to implement such an image compression using
only SVD (without using any image processing tools).
